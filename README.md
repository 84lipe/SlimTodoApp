# Slim ToDo App
This is a basic application, mostly a CRUD for managing a task list.  
I've created this application as part of training the basics of Minimal API, configuring EF Core and migrations.
Since this is a simple application I kept everything in a single project.  

Things to add to the application:

- [x] Create tests
- [x] Filter tasks by title, date and completed status
- [ ] Task details functionality (ongoing)
- [ ] Multiple lists
- [ ] Clone tasks
- [ ] Delete tasks
- [ ] Task priorities (smart organization someday...)

That's it for now.
